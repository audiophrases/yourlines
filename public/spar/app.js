/* ============================================================
   Sparring Coach — an opponent that plays the crowd.
   Moves come from the Lichess opening explorer while the game is
   still in book; a small local search takes over afterwards.

/* Every rating bucket Lichess exposes, low to high. These are the whole
   difficulty control: the pools you pick are the crowd the coach copies, and
   the coach plays whatever that crowd plays most in the position in front of
   it. Widening the selection buys coverage in a rare line at the cost of a
   looser opponent.

   A bucket is the FLOOR OF A BAND, and the band is keyed on the average of
   the two players' ratings — not either player's own. So 1400 means "games
   where the pair averaged 1400 to 1599", not "games by 1400 players".

   The explorer takes the number, parses it, and snaps it to whichever band
   contains it (RatingGroup::from_str -> select_avg), so it accepts anything
   and there is no such thing as an invalid value — only values that collapse
   onto a band you already have. Everything below 1000 is one single band, so
   600 and 800 would both land on it; it is offered once here as "<1000".
   At the top, select_avg has no branch that returns the 2800 group: every
   average of 2800 or more falls through to the last one. So 2800 and 3200
   are the same band too, and it is offered once as "2800+". */

/* Variety: which replies besides the main line the coach is allowed to play.
   A move qualifies on three counts at once, because any one of them alone
   admits junk — a move can be 30% of a position that only has six games in
   it, or be the second most played and still be a hundredth as common as the
   main line. Past the fourth most played there is nothing left worth calling
   a human choice at these sample sizes. */
const VARIETY = {
  take:        4,     // never look past the fourth most played move
  minShare: 0.08,     // at least this share of every game in the position
  minRatio: 0.12,     // and not dwarfed by the main line
  minGames:   20      // on a sample big enough to mean anything
};
/* On minRatio: share does nearly all the work, because the two are linked —
   a move holding 8% of a position cannot be less than about a tenth as common
   as the main line. It was set at 0.25 first, which quietly made the toggle
   do nothing whenever one move led: against a 72% main line no second choice
   can reach a quarter of it, so a reply played in one game out of eight was
   still thrown away. It is a backstop now, not the filter. */

   The pools are the difficulty control, and past the database they still are

   plies at about two thousand nodes a second: it covers the bottom of the
   range honestly and then simply stops, so every pool above the middle got
   the same opponent as the one below it and none of them got a strong one.
   So the coach is Stockfish now, held to the rating of the crowd you picked.
   UCI_Elo is the engine's own handicap, and it is a real one: it weakens the
   search rather than picking a good move and spoiling it afterwards, which is
   what a random move out of a shallow search amounts to.
   Below the floor Stockfish will name — it does not claim anything under
   1320 — strength comes off Skill Level instead, which goes as low as
   anyone needs. The old engine stays as the answer for a browser where

   is what makes any selection answerable: the pools become one number, the
   average of the band midpoints they cover; and that number is read off the
   curve below, interpolated between its anchors.
   Interpolated rather than bracketed, because tiers cannot answer the case
   that matters. Pick everything from under 1000 up to 2500 and a tier table
   has to choose between the bottom of that range and the top, and both are
   wrong — the crowd you selected is neither. The average lands between them,
   and the curve gives the rating that sits there.
   The anchors are ratings the coach plays at, not ratings of the crowd: a
   pool of human games at 1400 does not play like an engine held to 1400, and

   chess.js 0.10.3 rebuilds every move to disambiguate SAN, so moves() costs
   ~1.3ms, thousands of times more than evaluate(). Calling it at every quiet
   leaf is what would make this search take seconds; skipping it there does not
   cost accuracy, because a leaf only needs captures resolved when the move that
   reached it was itself a capture, a promotion, or a check.                  */

   calibrated to it, and a deeper one would silently restate every mark in the
   game — so deepening rewrites the two best moves and nothing else.
   Only an even depth is ever published, and that is the whole shape of this.
   A search of odd depth gives the side to move the last word, so a position
   with White to move reads high and the one after it reads low — and a rating,
   which is one subtracted from the other, charges that swing to the move. Two
   plies is balanced, four is balanced, three is not: measured on 1.e4 e5 Nf3,
   rating on three plies called every book move an inaccuracy losing half a
   pawn. So three is searched but never shown. It is the ordering that earns
   the fourth ply for the few moves worth spending it on.
   The budget is the other half. chess.js allocates a position on every move
   and undo, which puts this engine at about two thousand nodes a second: three
   plies across every move costs four seconds in an opening and over twenty in
   a middlegame. So a position too sharp to finish keeps the two-ply answer it

/* ===================== move rating =====================
   Two numbers decide a move's mark.

   Loss, in centipawns. A negamax score is relative to the side to move, so
   the value of the move actually played is the negation of the best score in
   the position it led to: loss = bestBefore + bestAfter. Both come straight
   from the full-window first pass of consecutive searches, which is the only
   place accurate per-move numbers exist — the resilience pass clamps refuted
   moves to `best` and runs a window too narrow to separate a mistake from a
   blunder.

   Trickiness, from the resilience the bar already draws: how many replies
   hold the opponent's position. One means a tightrope. That earns a discount
   off the loss, so a move that concedes a little but leaves the opponent one
   path is not marked down like a plain error.

   the same work in WebAssembly at a scale that makes fourteen plies ordinary.
   It answers for everything the shallow engine used to: the bar, the rating on
   a move, and the deeper reading behind it. The shallow one is kept but no longer stands in
   for it — see SF_ONLY. It still picks the coach's move once a position leaves
   the database, which is a different job: that one has to be weak on purpose.
   Nothing is searched until we know which of the two is answering. A rating is

   Served alongside the other chess apps at one origin, this one is where a
   position goes to be played rather than looked at. They all pass the board
   around the same way — ?pgn= for a game with its moves behind it, ?fen= for
   a position standing on its own — and either arrives here as a game to carry
   on with. You take the side to move, so the coach has the other one and
   answers as soon as you do.

   A handed-over position outranks the saved session: arriving with one is a
   clear enough request for it. The parameter is then dropped from the address,
   because startFrom has already saved the position as the session and a reload
   should pick up where you got to rather than start the handoff again. */
